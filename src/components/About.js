                        I'm Fernando Pulido, a senior at California State University, Monterey Bay, on a mission to transcend the boundaries of my
                        potential. As a Computer Science major with a laser focus on Software Engineering, I thrive on turning intricate lines of code
                        into innovative solutions. Join me on this digital adventure as I navigate the realms of technology, constantly pushing the boundaries
                        of what's possible.
